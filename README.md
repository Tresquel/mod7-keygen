# mod7 Keygen

A command line tool to generate CD, Office and OEM keys that use the mod7 algorithm

I used [this blog post](https://gurney.dev/posts/mod7/) to figure out how these keys work and how to generate them

# Usage
`mod7-keygen {-cd | -office | -oem} <integer>`
- The integer is optional, it specifies the amount of keys to generate.
